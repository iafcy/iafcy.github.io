### Hi! I am Yiu-Fai (Frankie) CHEUNG 張耀輝. 👋🏻

I am a final-year student majoring in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)). I am also enrolled in the [ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite) of the Faculty of Engineering.

My research interest includes AI for Mental Health, AI for Social Good, the reliability and safety of Large Language Models, multi-agent systems and other applications.

I am actively seeking opportunities for PhD programs. Currently, I am working closely with Prof. [Wenxuan Wang](https://jarviswang94.github.io/).
